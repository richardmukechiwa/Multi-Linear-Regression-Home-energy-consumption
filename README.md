# Multi Linear Regression : Home Energy Consumption Prediction

# Overview
This project aims to predict energy consumption using historical electrical usage data and suggest optimization strategies. By analyzing the provided dataset, I am going to build a regression model to forecast future energy consumption and offer recommendations for energy savings.

With increasing energy costs and growing concerns about environmental sustainability, it is crucial for residential buildings to optimize their energy usage. Efficient energy consumption not only reduces operational costs but also minimizes the environmental impact. Despite the availability of smart meters and energy management systems, many buildings still struggle to predict and manage their energy consumption effectively.

# Problem Statement 
The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that accurately forecasts energy consumption for residential buildings based on historical energy usage data particularly the sub-metering metrics. By leveraging data on global active power, global reactive power, voltage, global intensity, and sub-metering metrics, the model aims to provide actionable insights into energy usage patterns.
